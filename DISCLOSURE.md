# M-CORE — Prior Art & Method Disclosure (High-Level)

**Status:** Public Method Disclosure (Prior Art)  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document provides a high-level public disclosure of the methodological principles
underlying **M-CORE**, an external evaluation and governance architecture designed to
operate alongside large language models (LLMs).

The purpose of this disclosure is to:
- establish authorship and development priority (prior art),
- define the conceptual scope of the M-CORE approach,
- document an independent research line into externally governed, human-directed AI systems.

This disclosure is non-exhaustive and intentionally omits implementation-specific details.
It is provided for documentation and research transparency purposes.

## 2. Terminology and Definitions

- **External Evaluation Core (EEC):**  
  A modular control layer operating outside the neural weights of an LLM, responsible for
  evaluation, filtering, and long-term behavioral regulation.

- **Behavioral Valuation Ledger (BVL):**  
  A persistent system of evaluative signals (+/−) used to record outcomes of interactions
  and construct a long-term preference and constraint structure.

- **Human-Defined Objective Layer (HDOL):**  
  An interface through which human-defined goals, constraints, and priorities are translated
  into operational evaluation criteria.

- **Multi-Agent Collision Protocol (MAC):**  
  A structured interaction framework in which multiple specialized AI instances operate toward
  a shared objective under expert human oversight for cross-validation and error reduction.

## 3. Core Methodological Claims

This disclosure asserts the following high-level methodological principles:

1. **Separation of Model and Governance:**  
   Behavioral regulation, long-term objectives, and evaluative logic can be maintained
   independently from the underlying language model.

2. **Consequence-Based Memory:**  
   System behavior may be shaped by persistent evaluative records of outcomes rather than
   by raw conversational transcripts.

3. **Domain-Specific External Cores:**  
   Specialized professional behaviors can be instantiated by modifying the external evaluation
   core without retraining the underlying model.

4. **Structured Sensor Pre-Processing (Conceptual):**  
   Non-textual inputs (e.g., visual or acoustic signals) may be transformed into structured
   representations prior to interaction with an LLM.

## 4. Non-Disclosure and Limitations

This document intentionally excludes implementation details, including but not limited to:
- data schemas,
- cryptographic methods,
- internal evaluation logic,
- and integration specifics.

Such elements constitute unpublished research and are not disclosed in this public statement.

the described methodology. All rights are reserved by the author.

This document serves solely as a public record of conceptual development and prior art.
